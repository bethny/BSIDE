		<p>B-Side Magazine is College Hill's only music publication, focusing on student musicians and local acts in Rhode Island. We provide a place for the local music community to discover and discuss all things music-related. B-Side hopes to expose people to new sounds and get them to share their passion for music. Look out for some quality noise.</p>

		<p>Email us with comments, suggestions, or pitches. If you are a musician, feel free to reach out to us and we'll find a way to spotlight your work. If you are an aspiring writer, send us an idea for an article, outlining the main subject, what reporting you plan to do, and a short explanation of the general form. If you are a business/music venue, let us know about upcoming shows as well.</p>
